This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error and its solution.  The `bug.as` file showcases a potential runtime error when accessing nested properties within an event's data object. The solution, `bugSolution.as`, implements a robust approach to handle such cases, preventing unexpected errors and improving code reliability.  This is crucial for creating robust and stable ActionScript applications.
